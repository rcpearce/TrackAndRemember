% Analyze data from each subject
% The purpose of this file is to analyse the data from multiple
% participants, where the data from each participant is saved as an
% individual file. This will allow us to do analysis while still collecting
% participants, as well as quickly exclude participants we deem to be
% outliers

% IMPORTANT: Make sure you are running file in TrackandRemember folder in
% order to properly load scripts
